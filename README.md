# Fantasy Football Neural Network
#### Created by Adiel Felsen

## Description
This neural network is used to predict [fantasy football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(American)) scores for

## Resources
* This program uses [keras](https://keras.io/) to constuct the neural network
* [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) are used to structure the data
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is used to plot the results
* All data is sourced from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/)

## Neural Network Training

## Neural Network Testing


## Explanation of Visualizations
The players are organized in order of their 2019 ranking.
* Name of player is on the left
* The image in the center is a saliency visualization of the input matrix generated by Keras
    * Years are labeled on the left side, column labels are on the bottom
    * Unlabeled rows/columns are empty (filler) to make each matrix the same size
* The 2018 Prediction, 2018 Actual Scores and 2019 prediction are on the right
