# Fantasy Football Neural Network
#### Created by Adiel Felsen

## Description
This neural network predicts [fantasy football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(American) scores (standard scoring) for the quarterback (QB), running back (RB), wide receiver (WR) and tight end (TE) positions.

## Resources
* This program uses [keras](https://keras.io/) to constuct the neural network
* [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) are used to structure the data
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is used to plot the results
* All data is sourced from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/)

## Neural Network Training


#### Training Data ####

The training data is the statistics of each NFL player (in the relevant position) from 1980 to 2016 and is sourced from pro-football-reference.com
* These statistics include: Rank (Since 1980), Year, Age, Games Played, Games Started, FantPt (standard), FantPt (PPR), FantPt/G (standard), FantPt/G (PPR), Cmp, P-Att, P-Yds, P-TD, Int, Ru-Att, Ru-Yds, Ru-TD, Rec, Rec-Yds, Rec-TD, Fmb)
* Each player's career statistics are divided to generate more training data
  * For example, if a player played from 1990 - 1992, his statistics would be represented as three data points: 1990, 1990-1991 and 1990-1992
* Each data point is padded with zeros to make its shape (22,22)

#### Structure and Training ####

All positions are trained with the same sequential network structure:
* Two convolutional layers (filters = 22 and 10 respectively)
* A flatten layer
* Two dense layers (filters = 64 and 1 respectively)

For the current models (in Models folder) the epochs vary, to account for different training data sizes:
* QB position is trained for 300 epochs
* TE position is trained for 200 epochs
* WR and RB positions are trained for 150 epochs


## Neural Network Testing and Predictions

The neural network is tested with 2017 player data and 2018 labels. The results for each model is as follows:
* QB Model

   * Average Ranking Difference: 10.814814814814815
   * Median Ranking Difference: 7.5
   * Average Score Difference: 75.32401837596187
   * Median Score Difference: 60.54140167236329

* RB Model
   * Average Ranking Difference: 25.81896551724138
   * Median Ranking Difference: 22.5
   * Average Score Difference: 51.20686644408209
   * Median Score Difference: 39.091397857666024

* WR Model
   * Average Ranking Difference: 28.589147286821706
   * Median Ranking Difference: 24.0
   * Average Score Difference: 43.87782199133274
   * Median Score Difference: 34.15196533203125

* TE Model
  * Average Ranking Difference: 17.82278481012658
  * Median Ranking Difference: 13.0
  * Average Score Difference: 27.06946094292629
  * Median Score Difference: 17.481335449218747

Predictions are based on 2018 data. Predictions do not include any players who were not in the NFL in 2017

## Explanation of Visualizations
The players are organized in order of their 2019 ranking.
* Name of player is on the left
* The image in the center is a saliency visualization of the input matrix generated by Keras
    * Years are labeled on the left side, column labels are on the bottom
    * Unlabeled rows/columns are empty (filler) to make each matrix the same size
* The 2018 Prediction, 2018 Actual Scores and 2019 prediction are on the right
